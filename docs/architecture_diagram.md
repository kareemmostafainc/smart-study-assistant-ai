## 1. Overview

The Smart Study Assistant is a full-stack AI-powered web application designed to help students study intelligently through automated summarization, quiz generation, and progress tracking.  
It combines modern web technologies with advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to create an interactive and efficient learning experience.

## 2. System Architecture

The project is structured into three main layers:

### A. Client (Frontend)
- Framework: React.js  
- Purpose: Provides the user interface for all features — notes summarization, quiz interaction, dashboard analytics, and chat with notes.  
- Main Files:  
  - App.js — Core application container  
  - Dashboard.js, QuizPage.js, NotesPage.js, ChatPage.js — Feature pages  
  - Navbar.js, Sidebar.js — Reusable navigation components  
- Communication: Uses HTTPS API requests to communicate with the backend via RESTful endpoints

---

### B. Server (Backend)
- Framework: Node.js (Express)  
- Purpose: Handles user authentication, data storage, and integration with the AI microservice  
- Main Files:  
  - server.js — Entry point for backend logic  
  - routes.js — Defines all RESTful endpoints  
  - database.js — Manages MongoDB connection  
  - auth.js — Handles JWT-based authentication and authorization  
  - config.env — Stores secure configuration variables  
- APIs:  
  - /api/upload → Upload PDFs for summarization  
  - /api/quiz → Generate quizzes based on content  
  - /api/chat → Ask AI questions about uploaded notes

---

### C. AI Module (Microservice)
- Framework: Flask (Python)  
- Purpose: Processes text using NLP models for summarization, question generation, and contextual Q&A  
- Main Files:  
  - app.py — Flask API endpoints for AI operations  
  - ai_utils.py — Implements the logic using transformers and nltk  
  - requirements.txt — Lists Python dependencies  
- Endpoints:  
  - /summarize → Returns concise notes from PDF content  
  - /generate-quiz → Produces multiple-choice and true/false questions  
  - /answer → Answers user questions using content context

## 4. Security Architecture

- JWT Authentication: Secure token-based sessions  
- Input Sanitization: Prevents injection attacks  
- CORS Policy: Only allows trusted origins (React client)  
- HTTPS Only: All network traffic is encrypted

---

## 5. Deployment and Scalability

- Deployment Platforms: Vercel, Render, or AWS EC2  
- Scaling Strategy:  
  - Frontend hosted on CDN (Vercel)  
  - Backend as microservices for API and AI module  
  - MongoDB Atlas for cloud database  
- Future Expansion: Integration of personalized AI learning paths and analytics dashboards

---

## 6. Summary

This architecture ensures:  
- Modularity between AI and Web logic  
- Scalability for thousands of users  
- Maintainability with clear file separation  
- Real-world readiness for academic and professional use
