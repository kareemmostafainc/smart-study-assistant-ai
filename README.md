# Smart Study Assistant (AI Web App)

---

## Overview
Smart Study Assistant is an advanced AI-powered web application designed to help students study more efficiently and effectively.  
It enables users to upload study materials, automatically generate summarized notes, create interactive quizzes, track study progress, and chat intelligently with their notes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models.

---

## Objectives
- Provide an intelligent academic assistant for students.
- Automate content summarization and quiz generation.
- Enhance productivity through performance analytics and personalized feedback.
- Demonstrate full-stack AI integration for academic and portfolio use.

## Key Features
1. **Smart Notes Generator** – Upload any PDF file and instantly receive structured summaries using AI-based text understanding models.  
2. **Quiz Generator** – Automatically produce multiple-choice or true/false questions from the provided materials.  
3. **Study Tracker Dashboard** – Visualizes the user’s study progress, quiz results, and overall performance analytics.  
4. **Chat with Your Notes** – Engage in an AI-driven conversation about uploaded materials for deeper understanding.  
5. **Dark/Light Mode** – Allows seamless UI theme switching with persistent user preferences.  
6. **Login System + Cloud Save** – Secure user authentication with real-time data synchronization and storage.

## System Architecture
The project follows a modular full-stack architecture consisting of three main layers:

1. **Client Layer (React.js)**  
   Handles the user interface, routing, and data visualization.  

2. **Server Layer (Node.js + Express)**  
   Manages API endpoints, authentication, and communication between frontend and AI services.  

3. **AI Layer (Python + Flask)**  
   Implements NLP models for summarization and question generation using Python-based frameworks.
